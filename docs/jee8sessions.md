### Maintaining State Using Sessions in our JEE 8 Web App Module

Use these (but for JEE8) to update these code examples:

[Jakarta Servlet Specification - Sessions](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html#sessions)

We will now return to our charity registration example and start to introduce State and Session Management

##### [Maintaining State Using Sessions Start Branch](https://github.com/NicorDesigns/javawebdevcourse/tree/jee8web-session-management-start)

#### 1. We need a way to identify a unique user

#### 2. HTTP is a stateless network protocol

#### 3. HTTPSession is a way to maintain state between requests - shopping carts 

#### 4. A login user/password form usually authenticates a User and allows us to associate the users database profile

#### 5. We also associate specific work-flows with Users - registering Charities etc
