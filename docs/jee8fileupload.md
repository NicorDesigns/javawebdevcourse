## Using a servlet to upload files to a new JEE 8 Web App Module

##### [JEE 8 File Upload Start Branch](https://github.com/NicorDesigns/javawebdevcourse/tree/jee8web-file-upload-start)

### 1. Presenting the Charity Tax Document Registration project

#### Our Example Use Case

#### We run an online database of government registered Charities and Non-Profits in South Africa

#### Our example project will allow charities to "register" with us and send is their official tax registration forms 

##### Charities should be able to register their information online and provide attached files such as non-profit tax registration status and address details
##### We will also provide a "ChatBot" feature to guide potential charities who want to register with us
##### South Africa has 11 official languages and our example project will have to be able to support all of them
##### Because we handle sensitive information our example project will have to be really secure
 


### 2. Our example project starting layout

###### One Servlet - Three pages  

	1. A list of registrations
	2. A page to register - POST down-load-able Tax Registration Files
	3. A page to view a registration
